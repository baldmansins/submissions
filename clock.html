        <!-- Description Section -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Clock Choke is a gi-based blood choke that is typically executed from turtle position. It uses the opponent’s lapel and rotational body movement to create immense pressure on the carotid arteries, cutting off blood flow to the brain and forcing a quick tap.<br><br>

            To apply the Clock Choke, the practitioner establishes a deep collar grip under the opponent’s neck with one hand, then places the other hand on their far-side lapel or wrist for additional control. By shifting their body in a circular, clock-like motion, the practitioner applies downward pressure on the opponent’s neck, tightening the choke with their forearm and lapel grip. The rotation mimics the movement of clock hands, which is how the choke got its name.<br><br>
            
            The Clock Choke is a highly effective turtle attack, making it one of the best counters against defensive grapplers who try to stall in the turtle position. It is particularly useful in gi competitions, where lapel grips provide excellent control for finishing the choke.<br>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Clock Choke was developed within Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as a response to opponents turtling to avoid guard passes or submissions. While lapel chokes have long existed in Judo and Japanese Jujutsu, the Clock Choke became a signature submission in BJJ, especially for competitors who specialize in attacking from top positions.<br><br>

            This choke gained recognition as BJJ competitors refined their turtle attacks, leading to variations of the Clock Choke being used in high-level tournaments. Some of the most notable practitioners of this technique include Saulo Ribeiro, Xande Ribeiro, and Marcelo Garcia, who showcased the choke’s efficiency at the highest levels of competition.<br><br>
            
            In modern sport Jiu-Jitsu, the Clock Choke is one of the most effective finishes from turtle position, especially in IBJJF-style tournaments, where stalling in turtle is common. Its mechanical efficiency, strong control, and high success rate make it a fundamental technique in gi-based grappling.<br>
