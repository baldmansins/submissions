        <!-- Description Section -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Cross Collar Choke is a gi-based blood choke commonly used in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) and Judo. It is executed by gripping both sides of the opponent’s collar, usually from guard, mount, or knee-on-belly, and applying pressure to the carotid arteries, cutting off blood flow to the brain and forcing a tap or causing unconsciousness.<br><br>

            To perform the choke, the practitioner crosses their hands inside the opponent’s gi collar, securing a deep grip with both hands—one palm up, one palm down. By pulling the elbows inward and applying downward pressure with the wrists, the choke tightens around the neck. The technique is extremely effective and works even against larger, stronger opponents because it relies on leverage rather than brute strength.<br><br>
            
            Since it is a blood choke, it is faster and safer than an air choke, as unconsciousness occurs in seconds without causing long-term damage. However, if improperly executed, it can become an air choke, which is more painful and less efficient.<br><br>
            
            The Cross Collar Choke is a high-percentage submission, particularly in gi-based BJJ, and is one of the first chokes taught to beginners due to its technical simplicity and effectiveness.<br>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Cross Collar Choke has its origins in Japanese Judo, where it is called "Juji Jime" (十字絞, meaning "cross choke"). It was widely used in Kano Jiu-Jitsu, the precursor to both Judo and BJJ. Early Judokas incorporated the technique into Kosen Judo, a style of Judo that focused heavily on ground fighting (ne-waza).<br><br>

            When Mitsuyo Maeda and other Japanese Judokas introduced Judo to Brazil, the Gracie family and other Brazilian practitioners adopted the technique and further refined it. It became one of the fundamental chokes in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, often utilized by practitioners like Helio Gracie, Rickson Gracie, and Roger Gracie, who is famous for using it effectively in high-level competition.<br><br>
            
            In modern BJJ, the Cross Collar Choke remains one of the most effective and frequently used submissions in gi grappling. It is often seen in sport Jiu-Jitsu, self-defense scenarios, and even in gi-based MMA fights. Over time, practitioners have developed several variations, such as the Loop Choke, Bow and Arrow Choke and the X-Choke.<br><br>

            Despite the rise of no-gi grappling, the Cross Collar Choke remains a fundamental submission in traditional BJJ and Judo, proving its effectiveness time and time again.<br>
