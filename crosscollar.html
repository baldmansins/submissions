        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Straight Ankle Lock, also known as the Achilles Lock, is a fundamental leg submission in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, submission grappling, and MMA. It targets the opponent’s ankle and Achilles tendon by applying pressure with the forearm while controlling the foot. The submission works by trapping the opponent’s foot under the practitioner’s armpit and securing a firm grip around the Achilles tendon. By extending the hips forward while pulling back on the foot, immense pressure is created, forcing the opponent to tap.<br><br>

            This technique is one of the few leg locks permitted in IBJJF competitions at lower belt levels, making it a common entry-level leg submission for beginners. The Straight Ankle Lock is effective because it does not require advanced positioning and can be attacked from various setups, including open guard, ashi garami, or during scrambles. While primarily a pain compliance submission, in extreme cases, it can cause ligament damage or fractures if not released in time. Higher-level opponents may attempt to roll out of the submission, making precise control and finishing mechanics crucial.<br>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The origins of the Straight Ankle Lock can be traced back to multiple grappling arts, including Catch Wrestling, Sambo, Japanese Jujutsu, and Judo. In Judo, it was categorized as an "Ashi Kansetsu Waza" (leg joint lock), though it was not widely emphasized due to the sport’s focus on throws and pins. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu initially viewed leg locks with skepticism, with many practitioners dismissing them as less technical or "cheap" techniques. The Gracie family, in particular, prioritized upper-body submissions such as chokes and armbars, while other grappling systems like Luta Livre embraced leg attacks more openly.<br><br>

            Leg locks began gaining respect in the BJJ community due to the influence of submission grapplers like Dean Lister, who famously questioned why practitioners ignored half of the body’s available submission opportunities. This mindset shift led to a resurgence of leg attacks in modern competition. In MMA, the Straight Ankle Lock has been successfully used by fighters like Frank Mir, Kenny Florian, and Rousimar Palhares, proving its effectiveness in real combat scenarios.<br><br>
            
            With the evolution of leg lock systems, driven by figures like John Danaher and his students, leg attacks have become an integral part of no-gi grappling. While techniques like the Heel Hook and Kneebar have gained prominence in submission-only formats, the Straight Ankle Lock remains a highly effective and legal leg submission in gi-based competitions. It continues to serve as an essential technique for grapplers at all levels, offering both a direct submission threat and an entry into more advanced leg entanglements.<br>
