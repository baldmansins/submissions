        <!-- Description Section -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Ezekiel Choke is a gi-based blood choke that uses one arm inside the opponent’s neck while the other hand slides inside the sleeve to apply a tight strangulation effect. The submission is commonly executed from mount or inside the opponent’s closed guard, making it one of the few chokes that can be effectively applied from an inferior position.<br><br>

            The Ezekiel Choke is one of the simplest and most effective lapel chokes in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. To apply it, the practitioner threads one hand deep inside their own sleeve while the other arm wraps around the opponent’s neck. The choke is finished by pulling the sleeve-across motion while driving the forearm into the opponent’s throat, creating an intense pressure that forces a quick tap.<br><br>
            
            A unique feature of the Ezekiel Choke is that it can also be applied no-gi using a modified grip, sometimes referred to as a "Fist Choke" or "No-Gi Ezekiel." This variation relies more on the forearm’s cutting pressure rather than sleeve control but remains effective nonetheless.<br>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Ezekiel Choke was originally derived from Judo, where it is known as "Sode Guruma Jime" (Sleeve Wheel Choke). The technique was popularized in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu by Ezequiel Paraguassu, a Brazilian Olympic judoka who frequently used it during training and competition. Since the technique had not been widely seen in BJJ before, it quickly became known as the Ezekiel Choke in his honor.<br><br>

            In modern Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the Ezekiel Choke is widely used, especially in gi competitions, where the sleeve grip provides a strong leverage point. It is particularly effective in lower-belt divisions, as many inexperienced grapplers do not expect submissions from inside their own guard. However, at higher levels, competitors have developed counters to avoid being caught.<br><br>
            
            In MMA, the Ezekiel Choke has been successfully used, most notably by Alexey Oleynik, a UFC heavyweight known for his grappling prowess. Oleynik has secured multiple Ezekiel Choke finishes, even from bottom mount, demonstrating the submission’s effectiveness even against resisting opponents.<br><br>
            
            Today, the Ezekiel Choke remains a high-percentage submission in both gi and no-gi BJJ, with many practitioners using it as a quick and sneaky attack from dominant positions or as a surprise submission from guard. Its simplicity, efficiency, and adaptability make it a staple technique in the grappling world.<br>
