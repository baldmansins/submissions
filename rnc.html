        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Rear Naked Choke (RNC) is one of the most effective and widely used submissions in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), MMA, and self-defense. It is a blood choke, meaning it restricts blood flow to the brain by compressing the carotid arteries on both sides of the neck. The technique is executed from the back mount position, where the attacker wraps one arm around the opponent’s neck and uses the other arm to reinforce the choke. Properly applied, the RNC can render an opponent unconscious within seconds.<br><br>
            This submission is highly favored due to its versatility—it requires no gi grips, making it equally effective in both gi and no-gi grappling, as well as mixed martial arts (MMA). It is a high-percentage finish, as escaping a fully locked-in RNC is extremely difficult, especially when the attacker has a secure back control with hooks or a body triangle.<br>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Rear Naked Choke has origins tracing back to ancient martial arts. It was used in Japanese Jiu-Jitsu and later refined in Judo, where it is known as Hadaka Jime (裸絞, "Naked Strangle"). The term "naked" refers to the fact that it does not require a gi or clothing grip, unlike many other traditional Judo chokes. <br><br>

            When Mitsuyo Maeda brought Judo techniques to Brazil in the early 20th century, the move was adopted and further developed by the Gracie family, becoming a fundamental technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. As BJJ spread globally, the Rear Naked Choke became a staple submission in both sport grappling and MMA.<br><br>
            
            In modern MMA, the RNC is one of the most successful submission techniques, frequently leading to victories in organizations like the UFC. Fighters such as Demian Maia, Khabib Nurmagomedov, and Charles Oliveira have showcased the effectiveness of the RNC at the highest levels. <br><br>
            
            Its dominance in both sport and real-world applications makes the Rear Naked Choke one of the most important submissions to master in any grappling-based combat sport.<br></p>
