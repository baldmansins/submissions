        <!-- Description Section -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Arm Triangle Choke is a blood choke that compresses the opponent’s carotid arteries by trapping their own arm against their neck while the practitioner applies pressure with their shoulder. The choke is typically executed from top positions, such as mount, side control, or half guard, and is considered one of the most powerful submissions in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, submission grappling, and MMA.<br><br>

            To apply the choke, the practitioner isolates one of the opponent’s arms and forces it across their neck while wrapping their own arm around the back of the opponent’s head. Once the grip is secured, the practitioner applies downward pressure using their shoulder and chest, cutting off blood flow to the brain. The choke is typically finished by either driving forward with chest pressure or by transitioning to the side to increase the squeeze.<br><br>
            
            The Arm Triangle Choke is extremely effective in MMA due to its control and finishing mechanics, making it a preferred submission for wrestlers and top-heavy grapplers. It is also a favorite in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, especially for those with strong positional control.<br>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The origins of the Arm Triangle Choke can be traced back to Judo and traditional Japanese Jujutsu, where it was known as "Kata Gatame" (Shoulder Hold). The technique was used both as a submission and a pinning position in early forms of grappling, particularly in Kosen Judo, which emphasized ground fighting.<br><br>

            In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the choke became widely adopted as part of the submission system developed by the Gracie family and other pioneers of the sport. Over time, grapplers refined the mechanics, making it a high-percentage finish from dominant positions like mount and side control. The technique gained further recognition in MMA, where fighters such as Jon Jones, Khabib Nurmagomedov, and Brock Lesnar have used it successfully in high-level competition.<br><br>
            
            Modern BJJ competitors have also developed variations of the Arm Triangle, including the head-and-arm Ezekiel choke and mounted arm triangle transitions, making it an essential submission in both gi and no-gi grappling. Due to its combination of control, pressure, and submission potential, the Arm Triangle Choke remains one of the most reliable finishes in combat sports.<br>
