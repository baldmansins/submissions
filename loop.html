        <!-- Description Section -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Loop Choke is a gi choke that utilizes the opponent’s lapel to apply a blood choke, cutting off circulation to the brain by compressing the carotid arteries. It is a versatile submission that can be executed from various positions, but it is most commonly set up from guard, particularly closed guard, half guard, or seated guard.<br><br>

            To apply the choke, the practitioner grips the opponent’s collar deeply with one hand, then uses their forearm and wrist to apply pressure on the neck. By threading the other arm behind the opponent’s head and using a pulling motion while rotating their body, the choke is tightened in a looping motion—hence the name Loop Choke.<br><br>
            
            One of the key advantages of the Loop Choke is its ability to be applied during transitions and scrambles, making it a quick and unexpected submission. It is often used when an opponent attempts a guard pass, allowing the practitioner to capitalize on their movement and secure a fast tap.<br>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Loop Choke is one of the many lapel-based chokes that developed within Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, evolving alongside techniques such as the Cross Collar Choke and Bow and Arrow Choke. While lapel chokes have long been a part of Judo and BJJ, the Loop Choke gained widespread recognition as competitors sought ways to attack aggressively from guard.<br><br>

            Over the years, it has been used at the highest levels of sport Jiu-Jitsu, with notable practitioners like Marcelo Garcia and Cobrinha showcasing its effectiveness in competition. It is particularly popular in gi-based competition, where grips play a crucial role in offense and defense.<br><br>
            
            Today, the Loop Choke remains a high-percentage submission in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, often utilized as a surprise attack against opponents attempting to pass guard. Its combination of speed, versatility, and efficiency makes it a deadly weapon for gi-based grapplers at all levels.<br>
