        <!-- Description Section -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Triangle Choke is a highly effective submission in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), MMA, and submission grappling. It is a strangulation technique that involves trapping an opponent’s neck and one of their arms using the practitioner’s legs in a triangle-shaped configuration. The practitioner typically achieves the triangle from the guard position, by locking the opponent’s neck with one leg and their arm with the other leg, creating a choke that compresses the carotid arteries and restricts blood flow to the brain.<br><br>

            To execute the triangle, the practitioner isolates one of the opponent’s arms by threading it across their body while pulling the opponent's head downward. The practitioner then uses their legs to form a triangle around the opponent’s neck and arm, applying pressure by squeezing the thighs together, creating a blood choke. If applied correctly, the triangle choke can force the opponent to tap out or lose consciousness due to the lack of oxygenated blood reaching the brain.<br><br>
            
            The triangle choke is often favored because it can be applied both in gi and no-gi contexts and is one of the most versatile submissions in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, especially from the guard position.<br>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Triangle Choke has its origins in Japanese Jujutsu, where similar techniques were used to control and submit opponents. However, it was refined and popularized in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), where it became a signature submission.<br><br>

            The technique was notably developed and perfected by Helio Gracie and his students in the 20th century as part of the development of modern Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. The triangle choke was not originally a prominent technique in early BJJ competitions, but as the sport evolved, it became more widely recognized, especially in guard-based strategies.<br><br>
            
            The triangle choke gained global recognition during the 1990s, particularly after Royce Gracie used it in the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship), where he defeated much larger opponents with his superior grappling skills. However, it was in 1996 during the World Jiu-Jitsu Championship (Mundials) that the technique really began to shine, with Eddie Bravo famously using the triangle choke to submit Royler Gracie, marking one of the most significant moments in BJJ history.<br><br>
            
            Since then, the triangle choke has become one of the most commonly used submissions in both sport BJJ and MMA. Fighters like Anderson Silva, Demian Maia, and Charles Oliveira have used the triangle choke to win some of the most high-profile fights in the sport, further cementing its reputation as a dangerous and effective submission.<br><br>
            
            The triangle choke continues to be a core technique in BJJ, prized for its versatility and the ability to set up other submissions, making it an essential part of every practitioner’s skillset.<br>
