        <!-- Description Section -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Bow and Arrow Choke is one of the most powerful and effective gi chokes in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. This submission targets the opponent’s carotid arteries, cutting off blood flow to the brain by using the lapel as a choking tool while controlling the opponent’s body to maximize pressure. It is typically executed from back control, where the practitioner grips the opponent’s collar with one hand and controls their leg or hip with the other.<br><br>

            To finish the choke, the practitioner rotates their body away while pulling on the collar and extending their legs, creating a movement similar to drawing a bowstring—hence the name Bow and Arrow Choke. This motion generates immense force on the neck, making it one of the highest-percentage chokes in the gi.<br><br>
            
            The Bow and Arrow Choke is particularly devastating because it allows for precise control and a tight squeeze, making escape nearly impossible once fully locked in. It is commonly used in sport BJJ and is one of the most reliable finishes at all belt levels in gi competitions.<br>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Bow and Arrow Choke originated in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, developing as an advanced lapel choke that improved upon traditional collar chokes. As BJJ evolved, competitors sought ways to refine gi-based submissions, leading to the creation of lapel-dependent techniques such as the Cross Collar Choke, Baseball Bat Choke, and the Bow and Arrow Choke.<br><br>

            This choke gained massive popularity in competitive BJJ, especially during the rise of modern lapel-based attacks. Elite competitors such as Roger Gracie, Leandro Lo, and Rafael Mendes have showcased the Bow and Arrow Choke in high-level matches, proving its effectiveness against even the toughest opponents.<br><br>
            
            Today, it remains a staple submission in gi-based grappling, often seen in IBJJF tournaments and used as a go-to finish from back control. Its combination of mechanical efficiency, strong control, and lethal finishing pressure makes it one of the most dominant chokes in the sport.<br>
