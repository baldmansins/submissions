        <!-- Description Section -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Omoplata is a shoulder lock submission in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu that uses the practitioner’s legs to trap and torque the opponent’s arm, forcing the shoulder into an unnatural rotation. Unlike armbars or traditional shoulder locks that rely on the arms, the Omoplata utilizes the legs, making it a powerful submission that also allows for positional control.<br><br>

            The technique is often set up from guard, where the practitioner isolates one of the opponent’s arms, swings their leg over the trapped limb, and rotates their body to apply pressure to the shoulder joint. Once the leg is secured around the opponent’s arm and their body is turned perpendicular, the submission is finished by flattening the opponent’s torso and applying downward pressure on the arm.<br><br>
            
            Beyond just being a submission, the Omoplata is often used as a sweep, allowing the practitioner to transition to dominant positions if the opponent attempts to defend. It is a highly versatile attack that can be chained into other submissions such as the triangle choke, armbar, or wrist lock, making it an essential tool in a well-rounded guard game.<br>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Omoplata has origins in traditional Japanese Jujutsu and Judo, where it was known as "Ashi Sankaku Garami" (leg triangle entanglement). While present in early forms of grappling, it was not a widely used submission in Judo or early Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.<br><br>

            The submission gained more prominence in modern BJJ as practitioners began developing new ways to integrate it into their guard games. The Omoplata was popularized in the 1990s and early 2000s when competitors in both gi and no-gi formats started using it effectively in high-level tournaments. Grapplers such as Nino Schembri and later Rafael Lovato Jr. helped showcase the Omoplata as both a submission and a sweeping tool.<br><br>
            
            In MMA, the Omoplata is rarely used as a finishing move but has been successfully applied in competition. Fighters such as Ben Saunders and Adam Wieczorek have secured Omoplata submissions in the UFC, demonstrating its viability in mixed martial arts.<br><br>
            
            Today, the Omoplata is a fundamental part of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, with numerous setups and variations. It is frequently used in high-level sport Jiu-Jitsu, often combined with triangle chokes, armbars, and lapel grips to create a dangerous attacking system from guard. Its effectiveness as both a submission and a sweep makes it a crucial technique in modern grappling.<br>
