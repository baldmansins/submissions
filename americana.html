        <!-- Description Section -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Americana, also known as the keylock, is a shoulder lock submission that primarily targets the rotator cuff and shoulder joint by externally rotating the opponent’s arm at an unnatural angle. It is a fundamental submission in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), Judo, MMA, and submission grappling.<br><br>

            The technique is commonly applied from top positions, such as mount or side control, where the practitioner isolates the opponent’s arm, secures their wrist with one hand, and threads their other arm under the opponent’s elbow to grab their own wrist, forming a figure-four grip. By gradually lifting the elbow and pushing the wrist downward, the opponent’s shoulder is hyperextended, forcing them to tap.<br><br>
            
            The Americana is often one of the first submissions taught to beginners due to its simplicity and effectiveness, making it a high-percentage move in BJJ, self-defense, and MMA.<br>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Americana lock has been used for centuries in various grappling arts. It originated from Japanese Jujutsu and Judo, where it was known as "ude garami" (arm entanglement). However, it gained widespread recognition in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu after being refined and frequently used by the Gracie family.<br><br>

            The term “Americana” likely comes from early BJJ practitioners who saw American catch wrestlers or wrestlers in Vale Tudo matches using the technique, leading to the name "Americana Arm Lock." This differentiates it from the Kimura, which applies internal rotation instead of external rotation.<br><br>
            
            In MMA, the Americana has been successfully used by fighters like Royce Gracie, Matt Hughes, and Jon Jones, proving its effectiveness at the highest levels of combat sports. It remains a fundamental submission in BJJ and is often combined with the Kimura and straight armbar to create powerful submission chains.<br><br>
            
            Today, the Americana is a staple submission in grappling, known for its high success rate, ease of application, and ability to control an opponent while threatening a finish.<br>
