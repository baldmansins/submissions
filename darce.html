        <!-- Description Section -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The D'Arce Choke is a blood choke that compresses the opponent’s carotid arteries by using a deep arm triangle configuration. It is typically applied from top positions such as side control, half guard, or turtle, making it an effective submission in both gi and no-gi grappling as well as MMA. The choke works by threading one arm deep around the opponent’s neck and under their far armpit while locking it in place with a gable grip or palm-to-palm grip. The finishing pressure is applied by squeezing the grip and sprawling the hips, forcing the opponent to either tap or pass out due to lack of blood flow to the brain.<br><br>

            The D'Arce Choke is closely related to the Anaconda Choke, but the key difference is in how the arms are threaded—the Anaconda wraps the arm over the neck first, while the D'Arce threads under the arm first. The D'Arce is highly effective against opponents who attempt to turn to their side or turtle, making it a popular weapon for aggressive grapplers who like to hunt for submissions during scrambles.<br>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The D'Arce Choke was named after Joe D'Arce, a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt under Renzo Gracie. Although D'Arce did not invent the choke, he became well-known for using it effectively in competition. The choke itself existed before D'Arce’s time, particularly in Luta Livre and catch wrestling, but it became widely recognized in the BJJ and MMA communities after D'Arce demonstrated it in high-level training and competition.<br><br>

            The submission gained massive popularity in MMA, where fighters quickly realized its effectiveness in finishing opponents who shoot for takedowns or expose their necks in scrambles. Fighters such as Tony Ferguson, Dustin Poirier, Brian Ortega, and Nate Diaz have successfully used the D'Arce Choke in professional fights.<br><br>
            
            In modern BJJ, the D'Arce Choke is a staple of no-gi grappling and is commonly used by submission-focused competitors. Many grapplers have developed advanced setups from positions like half guard, turtle, and even standing, making it one of the most versatile chokes in the game. Whether in BJJ, submission grappling, or MMA, the D'Arce Choke remains a high-percentage submission that works at all levels of competition.<br>
