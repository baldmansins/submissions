        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Peruvian Necktie is an aggressive no-gi choke that combines elements of a guillotine choke and a D’Arce choke, using the practitioner's legs to apply additional downward pressure on the opponent’s neck. It is typically set up when the opponent is in a turtle position or shoots for a takedown, making it a powerful counter-attack.<br><br>

            To execute the Peruvian Necktie, the practitioner wraps their arm around the opponent’s neck, similar to a guillotine choke, while securing their grip under the opponent’s armpit. Instead of falling to their back like in a guillotine, the practitioner steps one or both legs over the opponent’s back, creating a leverage point to drive the opponent’s head downward while pulling up on the choke. The combined force of the arms and legs increases the strangulation pressure, making it an incredibly tight and painful submission.<br><br>
            
            The Peruvian Necktie is highly effective in MMA and no-gi grappling, where speed and unpredictability play a major role. It is less common in gi-based Jiu-Jitsu, as the collar grips provide alternative choking options.<br>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Peruvian Necktie was popularized by Tony De Souza, a Peruvian-born MMA fighter and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt. De Souza introduced the choke during his fights in the UFC in the early 2000s, and it quickly gained a reputation as a dangerous and flashy submission. The technique was later named after his Peruvian heritage, solidifying its place in BJJ and MMA history.<br><br>

            Over time, the Peruvian Necktie has been adopted by submission grapplers and MMA fighters looking for an aggressive and effective way to finish opponents who turtle or shoot for takedowns. While it is not as common as traditional chokes like the D'Arce Choke or Guillotine, it remains a powerful and unexpected weapon for submission specialists.<br><br>
            
            In modern Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and MMA, the Peruvian Necktie is a favorite among aggressive grapplers who look for dynamic and high-pressure finishes. Due to its unique mechanics and devastating squeeze, it is often considered a "trick" submission, but in reality, it is a highly technical and effective choke that can quickly put an opponent to sleep.<br>
