        <!-- Description Section -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Guillotine Choke is a popular submission in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), and submission grappling. It is a front choke where the practitioner wraps their arm around the opponent's neck and applies pressure to cut off airflow, usually while in a standing position or while the opponent is attempting a takedown.<br><br>

            To execute the guillotine choke, the practitioner uses one arm to encircle the opponent’s neck (typically around the throat), while the other arm is used to lock the grip. The practitioner then pulls upwards and slightly back, applying pressure on the neck to restrict breathing and blood flow. The choke can be applied from several positions, but it is most commonly performed while the opponent is bent over in a failed takedown attempt, with the practitioner grabbing the opponent’s head and pulling it into their chest while standing.<br><br>
            
            The guillotine choke is effective because it can be applied very quickly and can catch opponents off guard. It’s a versatile submission, and in MMA, it’s often used as a counter to failed takedowns or during scrambles.<br>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Guillotine Choke has roots in Japanese Jujutsu and Judo, where variations of neck and head locks were already being practiced. The choke became more widely known and used in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu after its incorporation by Carlos Gracie and other early BJJ practitioners.<br><br>

            In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the guillotine choke was refined to be performed with a variety of grips and angles, often starting from a standing position, or during scrambles as opponents attempt takedowns. The technique was also heavily utilized and perfected by Rickson Gracie in the early days of the UFC.<br><br>
            
            The guillotine choke gained global prominence with the rise of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) in the early 2000s. It became a signature move for many MMA fighters, especially as a counter to takedowns. Fighters like Frank Mir and Renato "Charuto" Verissimo were known for their successful guillotine finishes, and the technique quickly gained popularity as a deadly and versatile submission in both MMA and BJJ.<br><br>
            
            The guillotine choke continues to be a high-percentage submission, with notable MMA fighters like Nate Diaz, Kevin Lee, and Fabricio Werdum all using it effectively in high-stakes competition. Over time, the move has evolved to include different variations, including the high-elbow guillotine and the arm-in guillotine, each of which can catch the opponent in different ways and from different positions.<br>
            
            Today, the guillotine choke remains one of the most feared submissions in both sport grappling and MMA due to its efficiency and the speed at which it can be applied.
