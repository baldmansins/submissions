        <!-- Description Section -->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A Straight Armbar is a joint lock submission primarily targeting the elbow joint. It is executed by hyperextending the arm, applying pressure against the natural range of motion to force a submission. This technique is most commonly performed from positions such as guard, mount, or side control, and is considered one of the most fundamental and effective submissions in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) and mixed martial arts (MMA).<br><br>

            To perform the Straight Armbar, the practitioner isolates the opponent's arm, secures the wrist, and uses their hips to apply leverage, pulling the arm into a straightened position. The submission is completed when the practitioner applies pressure on the elbow joint, causing the opponent to either tap out or risk serious injury.<br><br>
            
            The Straight Armbar can be applied in various ways, but the key to its success is proper control of the opponent’s arm and body positioning to prevent escape or defense. It is a versatile submission that works in both gi and no-gi settings.<br>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Straight Armbar has roots in ancient martial arts, with early versions found in Japanese Jujutsu and Judo. In Judo, it is known as Ashi Barai or Ude-Hishigi-Ashi-Barai (腕絞り足払い), and was developed as part of the arsenal of joint locks designed to control and incapacitate an opponent. The technique was passed down from Judo to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), where it became a fundamental submission.<br><br>

            When Mitsuyo Maeda (one of the key figures who helped introduce Judo to Brazil) taught his martial arts knowledge to the Gracie family in the early 1900s, the Straight Armbar was adopted and refined by Carlos and Helio Gracie. Over time, BJJ practitioners integrated it into their guard game and submission strategies, making it one of the core submissions of the art.<br><br>
            
            Throughout the evolution of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the Straight Armbar gained prominence as a reliable and high-percentage submission. It became essential for BJJ practitioners to master it from a variety of positions, especially from the guard and mount. <br><br>
            
            In the world of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), the Straight Armbar has continued to be a staple submission, with numerous fighters utilizing it successfully in top-level competitions. Its effectiveness and versatility have made it one of the most feared submissions in combat sports history. Iconic figures like Ronda Rousey, Royce Gracie, and Demian Maia have showcased its importance in MMA, contributing to its continued relevance in modern fighting.<br><br>
            
            The Straight Armbar’s timeless simplicity and efficiency have cemented its place as a foundational submission in both sport grappling and self-defense.<br>
