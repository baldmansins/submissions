      <h1>Leon Waniga</h1>
      <p>
        Leon Waniga has always had an unrelenting love for food, seeing it not just as sustenance but as a bridge connecting people and stories. Throughout his life, he has faced challenging and dark times that shaped his path in unexpected ways. These struggles, combined with past decisions, have led to his current position on the Waniga Feasts blacklist. Yet, Leon's passion and spirit remain a reminder of the joy and unity that food can bring. We hold hope that he will find his way back to the light, leave behind his gang activities, and once again join the Waniga Feasts to share laughter, meals, and memories with the community he helped inspire.
