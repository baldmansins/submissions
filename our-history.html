              One for the ages. Waniga Feast 1 was the event that started it all — a legendary gathering that quickly became one of the greatest feasts of all time. Bringing together multiple friend groups from Mansfield State High, it created unforgettable memories, sparked new friendships, and set the standard for every feast that followed. It wasn’t just a celebration; it was the foundation of a community united by good food, laughter, and shared experiences. Over $200 was spent on this feast solely on Friend Chicken.

              Waniga Feast 2 was a pay-to-enter event that, while not quite living up to the legendary status of Waniga Feast 1, still carved out its place in history. Bringing friends together once again, it offered great food, laughs, and memories, proving that the spirit of the Waniga Feasts was very much alive — even if the first one set an almost impossible standard.
              <br><br> Despite the ticketed entry, the event maintained a lively and welcoming atmosphere. People mingled across groups, tried new foods, and celebrated in a way that reinforced the Waniga Feast tradition. Though it may not have reached the peak of the first, Feast 2 proved that the legacy was continuing, building anticipation for the feasts yet to come.
